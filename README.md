# AQI-prediction-model
An **AQI Prediction Model** forecasts air quality using pollutant levels (PM2.5, PM10, CO, NO2), meteorological data (temperature, humidity, wind speed), and time-based trends. It processes data, selects ML/DL models (Random Forest, LSTM), and evaluates with RMSE/MAE.  it aids governments, health advisories, and smart city planning. ðŸš€
